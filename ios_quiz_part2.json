        "a multidirectional connection between multiple view controllers",
        "this name does not have a meaning in iOS"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "A segue represents a one-way transition from a source view controller to a destination view controller. To go back, you use unwind segues."
    },
    {
      "id": 29,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "Which of the following methods allows you to pass data from source view controller to the destination view controller?",

        "viewDidLoad()",
        "unwind(_ seg:)"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "prepare(for segue:) is called before the segue executes, allowing you to access the destination view controller and pass data to it."
    },
    {
      "id": 30,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "This segue displays the view controller modally using the specified presentation and transition styles.",

    },
    {
      "id": 33,
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "If the segue looks like: source → destination. You define an unwind action method (that allows you to go back to source) in the destination view controller.",
      "correctAnswer": false,
      "explanation": "Unwind segues are defined in the SOURCE (destination of the unwind), not the destination of the original segue. The @IBAction unwind method goes in the controller you want to return to."

        "By using only GPS"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Using significant-change service (only updates on major location changes) and reducing update frequency significantly reduces battery consumption."

    {
      "id": 53,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
