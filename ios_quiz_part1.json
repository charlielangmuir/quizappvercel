  "questions": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "How is the optional type denoted in Swift?",
      "options": [
        "by adding a question mark (?) after the name of the type",
        "by adding an exclamation mark (!) after the name of the type",
        "by adding a question mark (?) infront of the name of the type",
        "by adding an exclamation mark (!) infront of the name of the type"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "In Swift, optional types are denoted by adding a question mark (?) after the type name. Example: var name: String?"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "In Swift, all types contain a nil as a possible value.",
      "correctAnswer": false,
      "explanation": "Only optional types can contain nil. Regular types cannot be nil in Swift - you must explicitly make them optional with ? to allow nil values."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "Which of the following expressions allows us to declare an array?",
      "options": [
        "var shoppingList = [\"catfish\", \"water\", \"tulips\", \"blue paint\"]",
        "var shoppingList = {\"catfish\", \"water\", \"tulips\", \"blue paint\"}",
        "array shoppingList = [\"catfish\", \"water\", \"tulips\", \"blue paint\"]",
        "var shoppingList = array[\"catfish\", \"water\", \"tulips\", \"blue paint\"]"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Arrays in Swift are declared using square brackets [] with comma-separated values. The var keyword is used for variables."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "In Swift, functions can be passed as parameters to other functions and they can be returned from functions.",
      "correctAnswer": true,
      "explanation": "Swift treats functions as first-class citizens, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as parameters, and returned from other functions."
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "Which of the following is true?",
      "options": [
        "In Swift, values are never converted (cast operation) automatically to another type",
        "In Swift, values are always converted (cast operation) automatically to another type if needed",
        "In Swift, conversion (cast operation) is not possible at all",
        "There is no such thing as a cast operation in programming languages"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Swift requires explicit type conversion - it never automatically casts values to another type. You must use explicit conversion like String(x) or Int(y)."
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "Which of the following expressions can be used to declare a function that takes an integer as a parameter and returns string?",
      "options": [
        "func foo(a:Int)->String",
        "function foo(a:Int)->String",
        "func foo(a:Int):String",
        "function foo(a:Int):String"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Swift uses the 'func' keyword to declare functions, with parameter types in parentheses and return type after -> arrow."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "Which of the following expressions would you use to print a variable x?",
      "options": [
        "print(\"Value of x is: \\(x)\")",
        "print(\"Value of x is: \"+String(x))",
        "print(\"Value of x is: \", x)",
        "All of the above"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Swift offers multiple ways to print: string interpolation \\(x), string concatenation with conversion, or comma-separated values in print()."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "Swift requires each line to be terminated by a semicolon \";\"",
      "correctAnswer": false,
      "explanation": "Unlike many languages, Swift does not require semicolons at the end of statements. They are optional."
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "Which of the following statement(s) can be used to declare an integer constant of value 5 in Swift?",
      "options": [
        "let x = 5",
        "let Int x = 5",
        "const x:Int x=5",
        "const x = 5"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Swift uses 'let' keyword to declare constants (immutable values). The type can be inferred or explicitly specified with a colon."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "Select the statement that is correct and the most complete describing Swift",
      "options": [
        "Swift is a strongly typed language that allows for the type inference",
        "Swift is a weakly typed language that allows for the type inference",
        "Swift is a strongly typed language that does not allow for the type inference",
        "Swift is a weakly typed language that does not allow for the type inference"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Swift is strongly typed (types are enforced) but supports type inference (the compiler can deduce types automatically)."
    },
    {
      "id": 11,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "In the function declaration: func swapTwoInts(_ a: inout Int, _ b: inout Int), what does 'inout' mean?",
      "options": [
        "_ means that when calling the function param labels has to be used",
        "inout means that params are appearing and disappearing",
        "inout means that params are input and output parameters",
        "_ means that parameters are optional"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The 'inout' keyword means parameters can be modified inside the function and those changes persist outside the function (pass by reference)."
    },
    {
      "id": 12,
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "The following two functions have the same type: func addTwoInts(_ a: Int, _ b: Double) -> Int and func multiplyTwoInts(_ a: Double, _ b: Int) -> Int",
      "correctAnswer": false,
      "explanation": "Function types are determined by parameter types and return type. These functions have different parameter order (Int, Double vs Double, Int), so they have different types."
    },
    {
      "id": 13,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "In Swift, a function is identified by which keyword?",
      "options": [
        "keyword func",
        "keyword function",
        "returned type with ->",
        "at least one parameter"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Functions in Swift are declared using the 'func' keyword, followed by the function name and parameters."
    },
    {
      "id": 14,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "Consider the following declaration: func add(no1:Int, no2:Int)->Int",
      "options": [
        "it declares a function that takes two Int values as parameters and returns an Int value",
        "it declares a function that takes two Int values as parameters",
        "it declares a function that returns an Int value",
        "this declaration is incorrect"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "This function declaration shows two Int parameters (no1 and no2) and returns an Int value (indicated by ->Int)."
    },
    {
      "id": 15,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "In the function declaration: func swapTwoInts(_ a: inout Int, _ b: inout Int), what does the underscore '_' mean?",
      "options": [
        "_ means that when calling the function param labels should not be used",
        "inout means that params are appearing and disappearing",
        "_ means that params are output parameters",
        "_ means that parameters are optional"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The underscore _ as an external parameter name means no label is needed when calling the function. You call it as swapTwoInts(x, y) instead of swapTwoInts(a: x, b: y)."
    },
    {
      "id": 16,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "Consider the following declaration: func minMax(array:[Int])->(a:Int, b:Int)?",
      "options": [
        "the function takes an array of Ints as a parameter and returns a tuple with two Int values or a nil value",
        "the function takes an array of Ints as a parameter and returns a tuple with two Int values",
        "the function returns a tuple with two Int values or a nil value",
        "the function returns a Int value or a nil value"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The ? after the tuple makes the return type optional. The function can return either a tuple (a:Int, b:Int) or nil."
    },
    {
      "id": 17,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "How many times will the following loop execute? for i in 1...10 { ... }",
      "options": [
        "5",
        "9",
        "10",
        "11"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The closed range operator ... includes both endpoints, so 1...10 includes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 (10 iterations)."
    },
    {
      "id": 18,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "In Swift a class...",
      "options": [
        "can inherit from one class but conform to multiple protocols",
        "can inherit from multiple classes and conform to multiple protocols",
        "can inherit from multiple classes but conform to only one protocol",
        "can inherit from one class and conform to a single protocol"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Swift supports single inheritance (one parent class) but allows a class to conform to multiple protocols (interfaces)."
    },
    {
      "id": 19,
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "Swift allows for functions to be nested (declare function in a body of another function).",
      "correctAnswer": true,
      "explanation": "Swift supports nested functions, where you can define a function inside another function's body. The nested function is only accessible within its parent function."
    },
    {
      "id": 20,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "In the following declaration: func pow(firstArg a:Int)->Int",
      "options": [
        "firstArg is the name used in the function call and a is used in the body",
        "a is the name used in the function call and firstArg is used in the body",
        "firstArg is the name used in the function call and both firstArg and a can be used in the body",
        "both firstArg and a is the name used in the function call and both firstArg is used in the body"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "When you have two names for a parameter, the first (firstArg) is the external name used when calling, and the second (a) is the internal name used inside the function body."
    },
    {
      "id": 21,
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "SwiftUI uses a declarative approach.",
      "correctAnswer": true,
      "explanation": "SwiftUI is declarative - you declare what the UI should look like and SwiftUI handles the how. This is different from imperative UIKit where you manually update the UI."
    },
    {
      "id": 22,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What is the name of the visual tool that is used to build layouts for the iOS application as well as to define navigation and transitions between screens?",
      "options": [
        "storyboard",
        "SwiftUI",
        "Layout editor",
        "UI inspector"
      ],

        "shouldPerformSegue(with identifier: sender:)",
        "viewDidLoad()",
        "unwind(_ seg:)"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "shouldPerformSegue returns a boolean - returning false prevents the segue from executing, allowing conditional navigation."
    },
    {
      "id": 27,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "This segue displays the new content using the showViewController:sender: method of the target view controller.",
      "options": [
        "show",
        "show details",
        "present modally",
        "present as popover"
